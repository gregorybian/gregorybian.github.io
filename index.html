        <h4 class="paragraph">Welcome to my portfolio!</h4> 
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="subtitle">About me:</span>
        I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). 
        I am passionate about using a combination of hardware and software building practical, innovative solutions to common problems.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="subtitle">Motivation:</span>
        At 13, I built my first computer. At 15, I developed a full-stack expense tracker using Java. 
        At 16, I competed in the Canadian Computing Competition, placing in the top 25% of participants.
        At 18 I built used neural networks and 
        Ever since my passion for computing has only grown stronger...</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="subtitle">Interests:</span>
        My current technical interests include Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Cloud Computing. 
        Right now, I’m focused on a machine learning project aimed at providing stock market prediction services, where I’m applying data analysis, neural networks and predictive modeling to help make sense of complex financial trends. </p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="subtitle">Extracurricular Activities:</span> 
        Outside of academics and projects, I enjoy maintaining an active and well-rounded lifestyle through exercise, sports, clubs, and personal hobbies. 
        I’ve been passionate about hockey since the age of five and continue to play to this day. 
        I also compete competitively in Ultimate Frisbee, most recently representing UVic’s Varsity Ultimate Team in the USAU Division I College Series.
        In addition to sports, I enjoy exploring new hobbies that help me stay balanced and curious. 
        Some of these include hiking, fishing, and photography—some of my work can be found on my photography <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gbflicks_/" target=blank>Instagram</a>. </p>
